# To-do
# MERN Stack To-Do App

This is a simple to-do list application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to create, read, and delete to-do items.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store to-do items.
- **Express.js**: Node.js web application framework used for building the server-side logic.
- **React**: JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server from the client-side React application.
